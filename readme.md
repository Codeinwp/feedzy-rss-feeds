## FEEDZY - The Powerful RSS Aggregator and Content Aggregator Plugin for Autoblogging ##

FEEDZY RSS Aggregator helps you aggregate unlimited RSS feeds and automatically publish them on your site within a few minutes.
With FEEDZY RSS Aggregator, you can sit back, let your site autoblog and always stay fresh with new content, which in return helps improve content marketing, boost your SEO, increase audience’s engagement, and probably earn more money.

## What you can do with Feedzy RSS Aggregator:  ##

* **[Feed to post](https://docs.themeisle.com/article/742-how-to-import-posts-from-feeds-in-feedzy)** (our most loved feature): automatically convert RSS feed items to Wordpress pages, posts, and custom post type.
* **Automatically import** and aggregate unlimited RSS feeds from unlimited sources
* **Bulk import and organize** multiple feed sources of similar topics into Categories. See how our user, Barry Seward, loves this feature [here](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/works-great-6051/)
* **Easily display RSS feeds** using shortcodes, Gutenberg blocks, or widgets in your third-party page builders like Elementor
* **Import images** with your RSS feeds or use your own image/logo for feeds without image. We know visuals are important and do not want your site to have a boring list of text and links.
* **Control number of items** you want to display for a feed source. Just want to display 1 article or 20 articles in a block? You’ve got it with one click.
* Worried if the imported feed articles’ titles are too long and might not look nice on your site? Change them with the **Title Character Limit** function.
* Choose your own **caching** time and how often you want to pull RSS feeds to ensure the **best performance** for your site.
* Create a **sidebar** of your imported feed items.
* **Control which meta** fields you want to display, such as author, date and time of the RSS feed.
* **Responsive** content across platforms.
