The plugin uses the SimplePie php CLASS natively included in WordPress. SimplePie is a RSS parser that can read the information contained in a feed, process it, and finally display it.

FEEDZY RSS Feeds therefore supports any additional library and uses only the bare minimum to ensure good performance (minimalistic CSS + cache). This will ensure compatibility with any hosting provider that supports WordPress, but if for any reason it doesn't work for yours feel free to <a href="http://themeisle.com/contact/" rel="nofollow">contact us</a>.

You may use this plugin in your widgets and your pages and reuse the shortcode + widget several times within the same page.

By activating this plugin, your cover picture will be inserted into your RSS feeds. By doing so, you'll make it will easier for external sites to retrieve images from your feeds.

**Please ask for help or report bugs if anything goes wrong. It is the best way to make the community benefit!**
