The plugin uses the SimplePie php CLASS natively included in WordPress. SimplePie is a RSS parser that can read the information contained in a feed, process it, and finally display it.

**Full cache control**

Choose right from the shortcode how often do you want your content from feeds to get updated.

**Feed Categories**

You can now group feeds into categories and reuse them across your content without worrying of their url.


FEEDZY RSS Feeds therefore supports any additional library and uses only the bare minimum to ensure good performance (minimalistic CSS + cache). This will ensure compatibility with any hosting provider that supports WordPress, but if for any reason it doesn't work for yours feel free to <a href="http://themeisle.com/contact/" rel="nofollow">contact us</a>.
